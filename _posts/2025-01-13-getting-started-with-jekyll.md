## Introduction

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. It's the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can host your Jekyll site for free on GitHub.

## Why Choose Jekyll?

There are several reasons why Jekyll stands out:

1. **Simplicity**: No database, no comments to moderate, no updates to install
2. **Static**: Fast, secure, and easy to deploy
3. **Blog-aware**: Built-in support for permalinks, categories, pages, posts
4. **GitHub Integration**: Free hosting with GitHub Pages

## Basic Setup

Getting started with Jekyll is straightforward:

```bash
gem install bundler jekyll
jekyll new my-awesome-site
cd my-awesome-site
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Key Concepts

### Front Matter

Every Jekyll page starts with front matter - YAML formatted metadata:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "My Post Title"
date: 2025-01-13
categories: jekyll update
---
```

### Layouts

Layouts are templates that wrap around your content. They live in the `_layouts` directory and allow you to have a consistent structure across your site.

### Includes

Reusable components that can be included in your layouts or pages. They're stored in the `_includes` directory.

## Creating Content

Posts go in the `_posts` directory with the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

Pages can be created as standalone markdown or HTML files.

## Conclusion

Jekyll provides a powerful yet simple way to create static websites. Whether you're building a personal blog, documentation site, or portfolio, Jekyll offers the flexibility and simplicity you need.
